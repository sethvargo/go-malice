# Malice

Malice is a package that demonstrates how an attacker could compromise a
software supply chain to gain access to privileged information.

## Usage

There are intentionally not usage instructions, because you really shouldn't use
this unless you're demonstrating security topics, in which case you already know
how to use it.
